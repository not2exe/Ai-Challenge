Automate iOS app testing workflow with the following steps:

1. Boot the iPhone 15 simulator and wait for it to be ready

2. Build my iOS app:
   - Project: [REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_PROJECT_PATH]
   - Scheme: [REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_SCHEME]
   - Target: iPhone 15 simulator

3. Install and launch the built app

4. Take the first screenshot of the initial app state

5. Find and tap on the challenge card:
   - Use get_elements_with_coords to discover tappable elements
   - Look for an element with label or name containing "challenge" or "Challenge"
   - Tap on that element
   - Wait 2 seconds for the screen to load

6. Take a second screenshot showing the challenge detail view

7. Send results to Telegram:
   - Send screenshot 1 with caption: "📱 Initial App State"
   - Send screenshot 2 with caption: "🎯 Challenge Detail View"
   - Send a summary message with:
     * Build status
     * App bundle ID
     * Whether the challenge card was found and tapped successfully
     * Any errors encountered
     * Timestamps of each step

Please execute this workflow and report any issues. If any step fails, send an error report to Telegram with details.
